            &nbsp; <br>
            At  the Jamaica Observer Limited we collect different types of information about  our users for three main reasons: <br>
            <br>
            1. To help us to  improve the services we offer. <br>
            <br>
            2. To provide personalized  services unique to individual users. <br>
            <br>
            3. To use  anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate advertising space on the  site. This might mean showing an advertiser how many users we have on the site;  it does not mean sharing an individual's details with an advertiser. Where we  collect registration information from an individual, we will never share that  individual's information with a third party, including an advertiser, without  that user's explicit permission. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Our principles</strong> <br>
            <br>
            We are absolutely  committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one  sentence: we will not share your information with others without your prior  consent. We have also established the following four principles: <br>
            <br>
            1. We will  continue to invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user  privacy through the appropriate use of the latest security technology. <br>
            <br>
            2. We will  respect your email privacy. You will not receive unsolicited mail from the Jamaica  Observer Limited and/or from third parties screened by the Jamaica Observer  Limited unless you have agreed to this. We will, however, mail you occasionally  with information about your registration and/or your subscription account. <br>
            <br>
            3. We will not  pass on any individual user details (including your email address) unless we  have your prior consent. <br>
            <br>
            4. Otherwise, we  will only share anonymous aggregate statistics about our users, sales and traffic  patterns with our advertisers. <br>
            <br>
            Should we elect  to change our privacy policy we will post the changes here. Where the changes  are significant, we may also choose to email all our registered users the new  details. <br>
            We also offer a  'My details' page, where you can update your personal information at any time.  You can get to this page from most pages on the site - simply click on the 'My  details' link at the top of the screen when you are signed in. <br>
            <br>

            <strong><u>FAQS</u></strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>What  information do we collect?</strong><br>
            <br>
            We collect  information on our users in two ways: through cookies, and through  registration. For more information about cookies, please see our Terms and  Conditions. <br>
            The minimum  information we need to register a user is an email address, a password and a  country. UK and US users will also need to provide a  postcode/zipcode. We will ask further questions for different services,  including competitions and subscription based services. Unless stated, all  registration questions are compulsory. We also ask some further, voluntary  questions so we can gain a clearer understanding of our users. Your responses  help us to sell appropriate advertising space and so keep the site free. They  also enable us to personalise services for our users. We do not share this  information with third parties unless you have specifically consented to this. <br>
            We also collect  data listing which of our pages are most frequently visited and by which types  of users. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>How does the  Jamaica Observer protect customer information?</strong> <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <strong>Will the Jamaica  Observer Limited disclose the information it collects to outside parties? </strong><br>
            <br>
            The Jamaica  Observer Limited will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to  others unless you have given us your permission. With your permission we will  only share the information with carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy  third parties. Also, the Jamaica Observer Limited may provide aggregate  statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site  information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include  no personally identifying information. <br>
            The Jamaica  Observer Limited follows the relevant legal requirements and uses all  reasonable precautions to ensure only responsible third parties see the  information, however we are not responsible for any breach of security or any  actions of any third parties who receive the information. <br>
            Please note that  we reserve the right to access and disclose individually identifiable  information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to  operate our systems properly and to protect both ourselves and our users.
